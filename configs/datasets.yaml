# House-level train/validation/test splits for each dataset.
#
# Each device entry defines:
#   app:                  Appliance name as it appears in the dataset
#   house_with_app_i:     All houses where this appliance has meaningful activity
#   ind_house_train_val:  Houses used for training (80%) + validation (20% time-block)
#   ind_house_test:       Houses reserved for final evaluation (never seen during training)
#   overlap:              Window overlap ratio for sliding-window segmentation
#
# Validation is created by splitting each training house's data temporally:
#   first 80% → train, last 20% → valid (with a gap buffer to prevent leakage).
#   See src/helpers/preprocessing.py:split_train_valid_timeblock_nilmdataset()
