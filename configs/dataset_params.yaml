#     → THIS FILE: training/loss/postprocess (OVERRIDES expes.yaml)
#       → HPO override (LAST, filtered for non-UKDALE)

# Each dataset section contains:
#   metadata    - Dataset description and sampling info
#   appliances  - Per-device thresholds, durations, device_type, houses
#   training    - LR, batch size, epochs, overlap, etc.
#   loss        - Loss function params (output_ratio, anti-collapse, etc.)
#   postprocess - Per-device power threshold and min_on_steps for prediction cleanup
