# Chapter 7: Limitations

Despite CondiNILMformer achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets and devices, this research still has several limitations worthy of in-depth discussion. Clearly recognizing these limitations is essential for properly evaluating the applicable boundaries of research outcomes, guiding practical application decisions, and clarifying subsequent research directions. This chapter systematically analyzes research limitations from four dimensions: method design, data constraints, generalization boundaries, and practical deployment.

At the method design level, conditioning feature construction relies on manual design and domain experience. The 13-dimensional conditioning features (5-dimensional electrical features and 8-dimensional frequency-domain features) selected in this thesis are determined based on mature experience in the electrical engineering field, but the feature selection process inherently involves subjective judgment without systematic verification of optimality through feature selection algorithms. Other potentially more discriminative electrical features may not have been included, such as power factor, harmonic distortion, and startup transient features that have been proven effective in load identification literature. Frequency-domain features adopt a fixed 8-band equal division scheme, which may not be optimal for devices with different periodic characteristics; adaptive band division or multi-resolution analysis methods such as wavelet transform may bring further improvements. Additionally, conditioning features are computed from the entire input window, coupling feature statistical stability with window length; under short window configurations, feature estimation variance increases, potentially affecting the stability and consistency of FiLM modulation effects.

Discretized device type classification is another method-level limitation. This thesis divides devices into limited categories such as sparse high-power, periodic low-power, long-cycle, and always-on types, configuring predefined loss parameters and gating parameters for each type. However, real-world device characteristics are often continuously distributed, and some devices may simultaneously exhibit characteristics of multiple types—for example, washing machines have both long-cycle operating characteristics and high-power pulse features during heating phases; simple discrete classification struggles to fully capture such complexity. Significant differences also exist between different devices of the same type; refrigerators of different brands and models may differ substantially in compressor cycles, power levels, and startup characteristics, and unified type parameters cannot optimally fit all individual devices. When encountering new device types not present in training data, existing classification rules may fail to provide appropriate parameter configurations, requiring manual intervention or retraining.

The six-component composite loss function, while effective, also introduces considerable design complexity. The loss function contains multiple weight parameters (main regression weight, recall weight, false positive weight, energy weight, etc.) and multiple threshold parameters (soft threshold temperature, recall margin, false positive margin, etc.). Although this thesis proposes an automatic derivation mechanism based on device statistical features, interaction effects between parameters remain difficult to fully understand and control. Multi-component losses may produce gradient direction conflicts during training, particularly when different components have large numerical scale differences, requiring careful normalization and weight balancing to ensure training stability. Compared to simple MSE or MAE losses, composite loss behavior is more complex; when model training encounters problems, debugging and diagnosis difficulty increases significantly, making it difficult to quickly identify which loss component caused abnormal behavior.

At the data constraint level, the three public datasets used in this thesis experiments, while serving as standard benchmarks in the NILM field, still have obvious representativeness limitations. Regarding geographical distribution, UK-DALE and REFIT both originate from UK households, while REDD comes from US households; these datasets fail to cover electricity usage characteristics of other countries and regions. Different regions have significant differences in voltage standards (110V vs 220V), grid frequency (50Hz vs 60Hz), common appliance types, and electricity usage habits; method applicability in regions such as Asia, continental Europe, and developing countries remains unverified. Regarding time span, the longest dataset recording time is 4 years, making it difficult to reflect longer-term electricity usage pattern evolution, such as family life cycle changes (children growing, elderly joining), device upgrades, and seasonal long-term trends. Regarding device coverage, experiments only target 5 traditional household appliances, not covering emerging load types such as electric vehicle charging stations, air source heat pumps, photovoltaic inverters, and energy storage systems, which are increasingly common in modern households and buildings with fundamentally different power characteristics and usage patterns from traditional appliances.

Data quality issues also affect experimental conclusion reliability. Public datasets commonly have missing data problems; data gaps caused by sensor failures, communication interruptions, and storage anomalies appear to varying degrees across datasets, and the linear interpolation filling strategy adopted in this thesis may introduce distortion in long-term missing situations. Device labeling consistency also has issues; device naming and classification standards may be inconsistent across different houses or even different versions of the same dataset; although this thesis performed standardization processing, unidentified inconsistencies may still affect results. Sub-meter measurement accuracy is limited, particularly with larger errors at low power levels, directly affecting training label reliability; some sub-meters are installed at circuit level rather than device level, causing labels to mix power contributions from other devices.

At the generalization boundary level, this thesis method faces domain transfer challenges. Different buildings have large differences in total power levels, device configurations, and electricity usage habits; when a model trained on one building is directly transferred to another building, performance may notably decline. Although the instance normalization mechanism can partially mitigate the impact of power amplitude differences, differences in device combination patterns and usage habits still constitute transfer barriers. Temporal drift is another generalization challenge; user behavior and device states change continuously over time—device aging causes power characteristic changes, user schedule adjustments cause usage pattern changes, new device purchases or old device retirements change building load composition—these changes may cause gradual model performance degradation during long-term deployment.

Extreme case handling is another weak point in generalization capability. When multiple high-power devices activate simultaneously, their power features overlap significantly in the aggregate signal, dramatically increasing disaggregation difficulty. Experimental analysis shows that disaggregation errors when kettle and microwave turn on simultaneously are notably higher than when operating individually; this scenario, while not frequent, does occur in real households. When device usage patterns significantly deviate from training data distribution—such as abnormal washing machine interruption, abnormal power patterns due to device failure, or user atypical usage behavior—model prediction reliability decreases. For extremely sparse devices, despite significant detection performance improvements achieved in this thesis, fundamental difficulties remain: microwave F1 score is only 0.13; devices with duty cycles below 3% have extremely few positive samples in training data, and learned patterns may lack sufficient robustness.

At the practical deployment level, computational resource requirements pose challenges for edge devices. CondiNILMformer's approximately 2M parameter model size, while not large among deep learning models, remains burdensome for resource-constrained embedded devices such as smart meters and home gateways. Compared to the original NILMformer, additional conditioning feature computation, device adapters, and multiple output heads increase inference time by approximately 20%, which may not meet latency requirements in application scenarios requiring real-time disaggregation. Sliding window inference requires caching historical data, also imposing certain memory resource requirements. Converting research prototypes to practical products also faces system integration engineering challenges, including interfacing with data acquisition systems from different smart meter manufacturers, supporting online learning capabilities to adapt to user behavior changes, and improving exception handling and fault tolerance mechanisms. Additionally, NILM technology deployment involves user privacy concerns; analyzing detailed device usage patterns can infer user living habits and home presence status; data collection, transmission, and storage all require full consideration of security and privacy protection, factors that may affect technology social acceptance and adoption.

The above limitations do not negate the value of this research but rather clarify the applicable boundaries and improvement space of research outcomes. Recognizing these limitations helps researchers and practitioners make reasonable expectations and decisions when applying this thesis method, and also points to directions requiring focused breakthroughs in subsequent research.
